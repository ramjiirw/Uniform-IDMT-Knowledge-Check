const quizData = [

{
question:"What is the primary purpose of IDMT?",
options:[
"To automatically remove or cleanse data using defined rules",
"To insert new case records",
"To schedule background services",
"To send automated notifications"
],
correct:0,
explanation:"IDMT removes or cleanses existing data in a controlled and auditable way. When a rule runs, it removes selected data and can leave the field blank, apply Data Removed, or use a defined replacement value."
},

{
question:"A Test run returns 2,450 records. What should be done before running the rule live?",
options:[
"Run it immediately",
"Delete the rule",
"Review whether the volume and criteria are correct",
"Disable audit"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"A large result set should prompt review. Confirm that the volume and selection criteria are correct before applying permanent updates."
},

{
question:"What must a rule contain before it can run?",
options:[
"An audit export",
"Selection criteria and at least one action",
"A DMS link",
"A scheduled service"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"A rule requires selection criteria to identify records and at least one action to define what change will occur."
},

{
question:"An administrator creates a rule with very broad selection criteria and runs it live without testing. What is the most likely outcome?",
options:[
"The rule will automatically fail",
"More records than intended may be affected",
"The audit will be disabled",
"The system blocks the update"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"Broad criteria increase matched records. Without testing first, unintended data removal may occur."
},

{
question:"When removing data using IDMT, what replacement options are available?",
options:[
"Insert a new case reference only",
"Replace with system generated audit ID",
"Leave blank, use default Data Removed, or define your own replacement text",
"Automatically archive the field"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"Removed data can leave the field blank, show Data Removed, or use a defined replacement value."
},

{
question:"A Test run returns zero records, but several matches were expected. What should be reviewed first?",
options:[
"The selection criteria",
"The audit table",
"The server status",
"The HTML formatting"
],
correct:0,
explanation:"If no records are returned, the most likely cause is that the criteria do not match any current data."
},

{
question:"Why is the Audit feature important in IDMT?",
options:[
"It increases rule performance",
"It records who made changes and what was changed",
"It blocks unauthorised users",
"It reduces database size"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"Audit provides traceability by recording what changes were made, when, and by which rule."
},

{
question:"An administrator creates a rule using KEYVAL to remove all related contact records for a specific case. What will be removed when the rule runs?",
options:[
"Only the email field within each contact",
"The entire contact records linked to that case",
"The case itself",
"The audit history"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"When KEYVAL targets related records in a child table such as Contacts, the rule removes the entire matching rows."
},

{
question:"Why should rules be clearly named and documented?",
options:[
"To improve processing speed",
"To support governance and future review",
"To allow automatic scheduling",
"To reduce audit entries"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"Clear naming ensures other administrators understand the purpose and scope of each rule."
},

{
question:"A rule appears to remain in Running status longer than expected. What should be considered before escalating?",
options:[
"The system has crashed",
"The audit has failed",
"The dataset being processed may be large",
"The rule has deleted itself"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"Large datasets increase processing time. Confirm the volume before assuming a fault."
},

{
question:"When is IDMT most appropriate to use?",
options:[
"For formatting HTML content",
"For one off personal changes",
"When removing or cleansing data across multiple records",
"For resetting user passwords"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"IDMT is most appropriate for structured removal or cleansing across multiple records."
},

{
question:"An administrator removes data but chooses to leave the replacement field blank. What will be stored in that field?",
options:[
"Data Removed",
"The previous value",
"Null or blank",
"An audit reference number"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"If no replacement value is selected, the field is left blank. The audit still records the removal."
},

{
question:"What happens when a rule is run live after testing?",
options:[
"The system schedules it automatically",
"The selected records are permanently updated according to the defined action",
"The audit is cleared",
"The rule disables itself"
],
correct:1,
explanation:"Running live applies the defined action to all matched records and records the update in the audit trail."
},

{
question:"After running a rule live, an administrator wants to confirm exactly which records were changed. Where should they look?",
options:[
"The email server",
"The system scheduler",
"The Audit log",
"The user permissions screen"
],
correct:2,
explanation:"The Audit log provides a full record of what was changed and when."
